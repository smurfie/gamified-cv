# Gamified CV

Gamified Version of my CV

## Description

This Curriculum Vitae is a project made a long time ago (2013) which I updated and adapted it to nowadays (Oct 2020). If you want a more complete and updated version, please visit my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-fluvia/). With each game completed you unlock a part of my profile and if you get all gold stars youâ€™ll have a 'surprise'.

## Try it!

You can see a live example at this [Live Server](https://gamified-cv.onrender.com/) or you can run it locally.To run locally download the project in a Zip file or clone the repo and run:
